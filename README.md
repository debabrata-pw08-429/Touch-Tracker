> Main Features and purpose of the application:
> 

1. **Typing Box:**
    - The application provides a typing box where users can input their keystrokes.
    - Users can see the keys they are typing appear on the screen in real-time.
2. **Visual Key Display:**
    - The application visually displays the keys that the user is supposed to type next.
    - This visual cue helps users focus on the correct keys and improves their typing accuracy and speed.
3. **Keystrokes Measurement:**
    - The application measures the number of keys pressed within a 5-minute practice window.
    - This feature allows users to gauge their typing speed and monitor their progress over time.
4. **Accuracy Measurement:**
    - The application measures the accuracy percentage of the user's keystrokes.
    - It compares the user's typed keys with the expected keys and calculates the accuracy rate.
    - Users can see their accuracy percentage displayed on the screen after the practice session.
