# Touch-Tracker
> Introduction:
> 

**Touch-Tracker** is a web-based application, designed to help users improve their touch typing skills. It focuses on practicing the 8 keys of the keyboard: `a, s, d, f, j, k, l, and ;`. The main goal is to help users develop muscle memory and typing speed by regularly practicing these keys.

<br/>

> Main Features and purpose of the application:
> 

1. **Typing Box:**
    - The application provides a typing box where users can input their keystrokes.
    - Users can see the keys they are typing appear on the screen in real-time.
    - This feature allows users to practice typing the specific keys (a, s, d, f, j, k, l, ;) without looking at the keyboard.
2. **Visual Key Display:**
    - The application visually displays the keys that the user is supposed to type next.
    - This visual cue helps users focus on the correct keys and improves their typing accuracy and speed.
3. **Keystrokes Measurement:**
    - The application measures the number of keys pressed within a 5-minute practice window.
    - It tracks and displays the total keystrokes made by the user during the practice session.
    - This feature allows users to gauge their typing speed and monitor their progress over time.
    - Users can set goals and aim to increase the number of keystrokes made within the given time frame, thereby improving their typing speed.
4. **Accuracy Measurement:**
    - The application measures the accuracy percentage of the user's keystrokes.
    - It compares the user's typed keys with the expected keys and calculates the accuracy rate.
    - Users can see their accuracy percentage displayed on the screen after the practice session.
    - This feature helps users identify and address typing errors, leading to improved accuracy and fewer mistakes in their typing.
